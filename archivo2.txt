Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet,
And so are you.

The sun in the sky,
Shines bright above,
A symbol of warmth,
And endless love.

The gentle breeze,
Whispers through trees,
A melody of nature,
That puts the mind at ease.

In the quiet night,
The stars do gleam,
A reminder of dreams,
And the wonders they seem.
